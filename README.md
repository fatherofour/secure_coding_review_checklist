# secure_coding_review_checklist
Secure coding review template aligned with OWASP Top 10 and NIST CSF

# Overview

This repository contains real-world insecure code examples across web APIs, backend services, and containerized environments. Each example demonstrates a common security flaw, its impact, and a secure remediation, aligned with:

- OWASP Top 10 (2021)
- OWASP API Security Top 10
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A

These samples are intended for:
- Learning secure coding practices
- Demonstrating AppSec knowledge
- Portfolio evidence for security-focused roles
- Audit, risk, and compliance training
